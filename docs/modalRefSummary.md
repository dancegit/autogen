# Modal Reference Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Modal functionality for programmers, including deployment, environment variables, managing deployments, building agents, security, scaling, and deploying Docker containers.

## Core Concepts

[The existing core concepts section remains unchanged]

## Deployment

[The existing deployment section remains unchanged]

## Security

Modal prioritizes security in its serverless infrastructure:

1. **Sandboxed Execution**: Functions run in isolated containers, preventing interference between different workloads.

2. **Secrets Management**: Use `modal.Secret` to securely store and access sensitive information:
   ```python
   secret = modal.Secret.from_name("my-api-key")
   
   @app.function(secrets=[secret])
   def secure_function():
       # Access the secret securely
       pass
   ```

3. **HTTPS by Default**: All Modal endpoints use HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication.

4. **Access Controls**: Implement fine-grained access controls for your Modal resources using the dashboard.

5. **Audit Logging**: Modal provides comprehensive logs for monitoring and auditing purposes.

## Scaling

Modal automatically scales your applications based on demand:

1. **Auto-scaling**: Functions automatically scale up or down based on incoming requests.

2. **Concurrent Execution**: Control concurrency with the `concurrency_limit` parameter:
   ```python
   @app.function(concurrency_limit=10)
   def limited_concurrency_function():
       pass
   ```

3. **Batch Processing**: Use `Function.map()` for efficient parallel processing:
   ```python
   results = my_function.map(input_list)
   ```

4. **GPU Scaling**: Easily scale GPU-accelerated workloads:
   ```python
   @app.function(gpu="T4")
   def gpu_function():
       pass
   ```

## Deploying Docker Containers

While Modal primarily uses its own container system, you can integrate Docker containers:

1. **Using Docker Images**: Import existing Docker images into Modal:
   ```python
   image = modal.Image.from_registry("your-docker-image:tag")
   
   @app.function(image=image)
   def docker_based_function():
       pass
   ```

2. **Dockerfile Integration**: Use a Dockerfile to define your Modal image:
   ```python
   image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile("./Dockerfile")
   ```

3. **Docker Compose**: For complex setups, consider using Modal's multi-container support to replicate Docker Compose functionality.

## Building Agents

[The existing building agents section remains unchanged]

## Advanced Features

[The existing advanced features section remains unchanged]

## Best Practices

[The existing best practices section remains unchanged, with the following additions:]

11. Regularly update your Modal client to benefit from the latest security features.
12. Use Modal's built-in scaling features instead of managing scaling manually.
13. Leverage Modal's container system for most use cases, falling back to Docker integration when necessary.

Remember to consult the full Modal documentation for detailed information on these features and more advanced usage scenarios.
