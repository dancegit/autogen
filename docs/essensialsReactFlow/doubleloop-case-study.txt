   Can you describe Doubleloop in a sentence?

     We enable organizations to understand how the work they are doing
     maps to the key outcomes they want to achieve.

   What problem or decision were you facing that made you decide to use
   React Flow?

     Developer ergonomics- flexibility in that the library is really
     solving the core of flow-charting and not something more bespoke to
     their original domain problem. Vibrancy of the project development
     seen through frequency of changes, community, bugs / PRs, etc.

   How are you currently using React Flow?

     It's the majority of our core user experience. Our users interact
     with all the of the domain objects in our system via the reactflow
     pages (we call them Maps). We have been leveling up our overall set
     of interactions to feel as natural as FigJam and Miro.

   Can you give an example of something about React Flow that you have
   found especially useful?

     It's the overall ergonomics that feel really nice. The library is
     opinionated on things that I want a flowchart library opinionated on
     like the overall domain modeling of a flow chart library but
     completely un-opinionated on all the things that should be like what
     exactly is rendered as a Node.

   Have you experienced any issues or challenges while using the library?
   If so, how were they resolved?

     Mostly around things that I attribute to the youth of the project.
     Overall its been developing in a great direction that we largely
     assess by how much custom code we get to delete when a new release
     is out because it's being handled by new internal APIs.

   How have the features of your React Flow subscription helped you so
   far?

     100% Pro examples. Those and the Discord chat have been all we've
     really leveraged to date.

   Our customers can solve their spatial problems thanks to our data
   catalog and analytical tools. We are using React Flow for our Workflows
   tool, which is our main visual tool to automate data preparation &

   Flexible data model visualization with Hubql and React Flow

   We were seeking a React library that helps us to turn data models into
   visualization without spending too much time building abstractions and
   interactive elements. To save time in development we opted for a
   stable, mature and feature-rich library that we can extend with custom
   rendering options.
