DevTools

   A debugging tool that provides data on the viewport, the state of each
   node, and logs change events. This component is based on [31]DevTools
   and Debugging under Advanced Use.

   You can import the entire <DevTools /> component, or optionally, import
   individual components for greater flexibility. These components
   include:
     * A <ViewportLogger /> component that shows the current position and
       zoom level of the viewport.
     * A <NodeInspector /> component that reveals the state of each node.
     * A <ChangeLogger /> that wraps your flow's onNodesChange handler and
       logs each change as it is dispatched.

   You can read more about the individual components at [32]DevTools and
   Debugging. While we find these tools useful for making sure React Flow
   is working properly, you might also find them useful for debugging your
   applications as your flows and their interactions become more complex.
