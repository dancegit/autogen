   Theming

Theming

   React Flow has been built with deep customization in mind. Many of our
   users fully transform the look and feel of React Flow to match their
   own brand or design system. This guide will introduce you to the
   different ways you can customize React Flow's appearance.

Default styles

   React Flow's default styles are enough to get going with the built-in
   nodes. They provide some sensible defaults for styles like padding,
   border radius, and animated edges. You can see what they look like
   below:

   IFRAME:
   [59]https://example-apps.xyflow.com/react/examples/styling/default-styl
   e/index.html

   (BUTTON) Open in Stackblitz (BUTTON) Open in Codesandbox

   You'll typically load these default styles by importing them in you
   App.jsx file or other entry point:
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';

   (BUTTON)

   Without dipping into [60]custom nodes and [61]edges, there are three
   ways you can style React Flow's basic look:
     * Passing inline styles through style props
     * Overriding the built-in classes with custom CSS
     * Overriding the CSS variables React Flow uses

Built in dark and light mode

   You can chose one of the built-in color modes by using the colorMode
   prop (`dark', `light' or `system') as seen in the [62]dark mode
   example.
import ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react';

export default function Flow() {
  return <ReactFlow colorMode="dark" nodes={[...]} edges={[...]} />
}

   (BUTTON)

   When you use the colorMode prop, React Flow adds a class to the root
   element (.react-flow) that you can use to style your flow based on the
   color mode:
.dark .react-flow__node {
  background: #777;
  color: white;
}

.light .react-flow__node {
  background: white;
  color: #111;
}

   (BUTTON)

Customizing with style props

   The easiest way to start customising the look and feel of your flows is
   to use the style prop found on many of React Flow's components to
   inline your own CSS.
import ReactFlow from '@xyflow/react'

const styles = {
  background: 'red',
  width: '100%',
  height: 300,
};

export default function Flow() {
  return <ReactFlow style={styles} nodes={[...]} edges={[...]} />
}

   (BUTTON)

CSS variables

   If you don't want to replace the default styles entirely but just want
   to tweak the overall look and feel, you can override some of the CSS
   variables we use throughout the library. For an example of how to use
   these CSS variables, check out our [63]Feature Overview example.

   These variables are mostly self-explanatory. Below is a table of all
   the variables you might want to tweak and their default values for
   reference:
   Variable name Default
   --xy-edge-stroke-default #b1b1b7
   --xy-edge-stroke-width-default 1
   --xy-edge-stroke-selected-default #555
   --xy-connectionline-stroke-default #b1b1b7
   --xy-connectionline-stroke-width-default 1
   --xy-attribution-background-color-default rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
   --xy-minimap-background-color-default #fff
   --xy-background-pattern-dots-color-default #91919a
   --xy-background-pattern-line-color-default #eee
   --xy-background-pattern-cross-color-default #e2e2e2
   --xy-node-color-default inherit
   --xy-node-border-default 1px solid #1a192b
   --xy-node-background-color-default #fff
   --xy-node-group-background-color-default rgba(240, 240, 240, 0.25)
   --xy-node-boxshadow-hover-default 0 1px 4px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)
   --xy-node-boxshadow-selected-default 0 0 0 0.5px #1a192b
   --xy-handle-background-color-default #1a192b
   --xy-handle-border-color-default #fff
   --xy-selection-background-color-default rgba(0, 89, 220, 0.08)
   --xy-selection-border-default 1px dotted rgba(0, 89, 220, 0.8)
   --xy-controls-button-background-color-default #fefefe
   --xy-controls-button-background-color-hover-default #f4f4f4
   --xy-controls-button-color-default inherit
   --xy-controls-button-color-hover-default inherit
   --xy-controls-button-border-color-default #eee
   --xy-controls-box-shadow-default 0 0 2px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)
   --xy-resize-background-color-default #3367d9

   These variables are used to define the defaults for the various
   elements of React Flow. This means they can still be overriden by
   inline styles or custom classes on a per-element basis. If you want to
   override these variables, you can do so by adding:
.react-flow {
  --xy-node-background-color-default: #ff5050;
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   Be aware that these variables are defined under .react-flow and under
   :root.

Overriding built-in classes

   Some consider heavy use of inline styles to be an anti-pattern. In that
   case, you can override the built-in classes that React Flow uses with
   your own CSS. There are many classes attached to all sorts of elements
   in React Flow, but the ones you'll likely want to override are listed
   below:
   Class name Description
   .react-flow The outermost container
   .react-flow__renderer The inner container
   .react-flow__zoompane Zoom & pan pane
   .react-flow__selectionpane Selection pane
   .react-flow__selection User selection
   .react-flow__edges The element containing all edges in the flow
   .react-flow__edge Applied to each [64]Edge in the flow
   .react-flow__edge.selected Added to an [65]Edge when selected
   .react-flow__edge.animated Added to an [66]Edge when its animated prop
   is true
   .react-flow__edge.updating Added to an [67]Edge while it gets updated
   via onReconnect
   .react-flow__edge-path The SVG <path /> element of an [68]Edge
   .react-flow__edge-text The SVG <text /> element of an [69]Edge label
   .react-flow__edge-textbg The SVG <text /> element behind an [70]Edge
   label
   .react-flow__connection Applied to the current connection line
   .react-flow__connection-path The SVG <path /> of a connection line
   .react-flow__nodes The element containing all nodes in the flow
   .react-flow__node Applied to each [71]Node in the flow
   .react-flow__node.selected Added to a [72]Node when selected.
   .react-flow__node-default Added when [73]Node type is "default"
   .react-flow__node-input Added when [74]Node type is "input"
   .react-flow__node-output Added when [75]Node type is "output"
   .react-flow__nodesselection Nodes selection
   .react-flow__nodesselection-rect Nodes selection rect
   .react-flow__handle Applied to each [76]<Handle /> component
   .react-flow__handle-top Applied when a handle's [77]Position is set to
   "top"
   .react-flow__handle-right Applied when a handle's [78]Position is set
   to "right"
   .react-flow__handle-bottom Applied when a handle's [79]Position is set
   to "bottom"
   .react-flow__handle-left Applied when a handle's [80]Position is set to
   "left"
   .connectingfrom Added to a Handle when a connection line is above a
   handle.
   .connectingto Added to a Handle when a connection line is above a
   handle.
   .valid Added to a Handle when a connection line is above and the
   connection is valid
   .react-flow__background Applied to the [81]<Background /> component
   .react-flow__minimap Applied to the [82]<MiniMap /> component
   .react-flow__controls Applied to the [83]<Controls /> component
   !!!

   Be careful if you go poking around the source code looking for other
   classes to override. Some classes are used internally and are required
   in order for the library to be functional. If you replace them you may
   end up with unexpected bugs or errors!

Third-party solutions

   You can choose to opt-out of React Flow's default styling altogether
   and use a third-party styling solution instead. If you want to do this,
   you must make sure you still import the base styles.
import '@xyflow/react/dist/base.css';

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   These base styles are required for React Flow to function correctly. If
   you don't import them or you override them with your own styles, some
   things might not work as expected!

   IFRAME:
   [84]https://example-apps.xyflow.com/react/examples/styling/base-style/i
   ndex.html

   (BUTTON) Open in Stackblitz (BUTTON) Open in Codesandbox

Styled Components

   Many of the components you render directly, such as the [85]<MiniMap
   />, accept both className and style props. This means you can use any
   styling solution you like, such as [86]Styled Components:
import { MiniMap } from '@xyflow/react';

const StyledMiniMap = styled(MiniMap)`
  background-color: ${(props) => props.theme.bg};

  .react-flow__minimap-mask {
    fill: ${(props) => props.theme.minimapMaskBg};
  }

  .react-flow__minimap-node {
    fill: ${(props) => props.theme.nodeBg};
    stroke: none;
  }
`;

   (BUTTON)

   check out [87]the example!

TailwindCSS

   Custom nodes and edges are just React components, and you can use any
   styling solution you'd like to style them. For example, you might want
   to use [88]Tailwind to style your nodes:
function CustomNode({ data }) {
  return (
    <div className="px-4 py-2 shadow-md rounded-md bg-white border-2 border-ston
e-400">
      <div className="flex">
        <div className="rounded-full w-12 h-12 flex justify-center items-center
bg-gray-100">
          {data.emoji}
        </div>
        <div className="ml-2">
          <div className="text-lg font-bold">{data.name}</div>
          <div className="text-gray-500">{data.job}</div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <Handle
        type="target"
        position={Position.Top}
        className="w-16 !bg-teal-500"
      />
      <Handle
        type="source"
        position={Position.Bottom}
        className="w-16 !bg-teal-500"
      />
    </div>
  );
}

   (BUTTON)
   !!!

   If you want to overwrite default styles, make sure to import Tailwinds
   entry point after React Flows base styles.
import '@xyflow/react/dist/style.css';
import 'tailwind.css';
