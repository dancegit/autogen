   Remove Attribution

Remove Attribution

   This example demonstrates how you can remove the React Flow attribution
   from the renderer.

   If you're considering removing the attribution, we'd first like to
   mention:

   If you're using React Flow at your organization and making money from
   it, we rely on your support to keep React Flow developed and maintained
   under an MIT License. Before you remove the attribution, [51]see the
   ways you can support React Flow to keep it running.

   Are you using React Flow for a personal project? Great! Go ahead and
   remove the attribution. You can support us by reporting any bugs you
   find, sending us screenshots of your projects, and starring us on
   [52]Github. If you start making money using React Flow or use it in an
   organization in the future, we would ask that you re-add the
   attribution or sign up for one of our subscriptions.

   Thank you for supporting us mV¸»
