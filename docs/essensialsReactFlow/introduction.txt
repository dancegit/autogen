   Introduction

Introduction

   React Flow is a library for building node-based applications. These can
   be anything from simple static diagrams to data visualisations to
   complex visual editors. You can implement custom node types and edges
   and it comes with components like a minimap and viewport controls out
   of the box.

   If you're looking to get started quickly check out the [52]quickstart
   guide, otherwise, let's take a look at React Flow's key features.

Key Features

   Easy to use: React Flow already comes with many of the features you
   want out of the box. Dragging nodes around, zooming and panning,
   selecting multiple nodes and edges, and adding/removing edges are all
   built-in.

   ¨ Customizable: React Flow supports custom node types and edge types.
   Because custom nodes are just React components, you can implement
   anything you need: you're not locked in to the built-in node types.
   Custom edges let you add labels, controls, and bespoke logic to node
   edges.

   !V! Fast rendering: React Flow only renders nodes that have changed,
   and makes sures only those that are in the viewport are displayed at
   all.

   © Built-in plugins: We ship React Flow with a few plugins out of the
   box:
     * The [53]<Background /> plugin implements some basic customisable
       background patterns.
     * The [54]<MiniMap /> plugin displays a small version of the graph in
       the corner of the screen.
     * The [55]<Controls /> plugin adds controls to zoom, center, and lock
       the viewport.
     * The [56]<Panel /> plugin makes it easy to position content on top
       of the viewport.
     * The [57]<NodeToolbar /> plugin lets you render a toolbar attached
       to a node.
     * The [58]<NodeResizer /> plugin makes it easy to add resize
       funtionality to your nodes.

   ª Reliable: React Flow is entirely written in TypeScript to catch bugs
   early and make fixes easy. For everything else, we have a robust
   cypress test suite so you can depend on React Flow with confidence .

Moving on

   Now that you have a better idea of what React Flow is all about, the
   next page will walk through some common terminology that you will see
   repeated throughout the documentation: nodes, edges, and handles.
