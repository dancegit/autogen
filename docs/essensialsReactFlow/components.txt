React Flow Components

   This is a collection of useful components that you can easily integrate
   into your React Flow application. It utilizes the new [24]shadcn CLI,
   which builds on top of [25]Tailwind CSS and [26]shadcn/ui components.

Prerequisites

   You need to have shadcn and tailwind configured in your project. If you
   haven't installed it, you can follow the steps explained in the
   [27]shadcn installation guide. If shadcn and tailwind are part of your
   project, you can initialize shadcn-ui by running:
   (BUTTON)
   (BUTTON) npm (BUTTON) pnpm (BUTTON) yarn (BUTTON) bun
npx shadcn@latest init

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
yarn dlx shadcn@latest init

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
bun x shadcn@latest init

   If you want to learn more about the motivation behind this project, you
   can find a detailed blog post [28]here.

Usage

   Find a component you like and run the command to add it to your
   project.
   (BUTTON)
   (BUTTON) npm (BUTTON) pnpm (BUTTON) yarn (BUTTON) bun
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name

   (BUTTON) (BUTTON)
bun x shadcn@latest add https://ui.reactflow.dev/component-name

     * This command copies the component code inside your components
       folder. You can change this folder by adding an alias inside your
       components.json.
     * It automatically installs all necessary dependencies
     * It utilizes previously added and even modified components or asks
       you if you'd like to overwrite them.
     * It uses your existing tailwind configuration.
     * The components are not black-boxes and can be modified and extended
       to fit your needs.
