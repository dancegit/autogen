Privacy policy

   [85]Aider AI LLC ("Aider," "we," "our," and/or "us") values the privacy
   of individuals who use our website, programming tools, and related
   services (collectively, our "Services"). This privacy policy (the
   "Privacy Policy") explains how we collect, use, and disclose
   information from users of our Services. By using our Services, you
   agree to the collection, use, disclosure, and procedures this Privacy
   Policy describes.

Information We Collect

   We may collect a variety of information from or about you or your
   devices from various sources, as described below.

A. Information You Provide to Us.

   Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional
   information about you, such as your name, email address, the contents
   of a message or attachments that you may send to us, and other
   information you choose to provide.

B. Information We Collect When You Use Our Services.

   Device Information. We may receive information about the device and
   software you use to access our Services, including IP address, device
   type, device identifiers, web browser type and version, and operating
   system version.

   Usage Information. We may automatically receive information about your
   interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you
   view, referrer information (the website you visited before coming to
   our Services), and the dates and times of your visits.

   Analytics Information. If you use our programming tools, we may receive
   information about your interactions with the tools, such as how often
   certain features or commands are used, information about exceptions and
   errors, and which large language models are used. This information is
   associated with a randomly generated identifier, not any directly
   identifiable user information such as your name or email address.
   Please see the "Your Choices" section below for information on how to
   disable the collection of this information.

   Information from Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. We and our
   third-party partners may collect information about your activities on
   our Services using cookies, pixel tags, SDKs, or other tracking
   technologies. Our third-party partners, such as analytics and security
   partners, may also use these technologies to collect information about
   your online activities over time and across different services.

How We Use the Information We Collect

   We use the information we collect:
     * To provide, maintain, improve, and enhance our Services;
     * To understand and analyze how you use our Services and develop new
       products, services, features, and functionality;
     * To communicate with you, provide you with updates and other
       information relating to our Services, provide information that you
       request, respond to comments and questions, and otherwise provide
       customer support;
     * To generate anonymized or aggregate data containing only
       de-identified, non-personal information that we may use for any
       lawful purposes such as to publish reports;
     * To find and prevent fraud and abuse, and respond to trust and
       safety issues that may arise;
     * For compliance purposes, including enforcing our legal rights, or
       as may be required by applicable laws and regulations or requested
       by any judicial process or governmental agency; and
     * For other purposes for which we provide specific notice at the time
       the information is collected.

How We Disclose the Information We Collect

   Affiliates. We may disclose any information we receive to our current
   or future affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Privacy
   Policy.

   Vendors and Service Providers. We may disclose any information we
   receive to vendors and service providers retained in connection with
   the provision of our Services.

   Analytics Partners. We may use analytics services to collect and
   process certain analytics data to improve our Services, such as by
   improving the ability of our programming tools to work with LLMs, edit
   code, and complete user requests.

   As Required By Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve,
   and disclose your information if we believe doing so is required or
   appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal
   process, such as a court order or subpoena; (b) respond to your
   requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others' rights, property, or
   safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information
   may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the
   Services.

   Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. We may transfer your
   information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional
   partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration,
   negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are
   acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or
   transfer all or a portion of our assets. The use of your information
   following any of these events will be governed by the provisions of
   this Privacy Policy in effect at the time the applicable information
   was collected.

   Consent. We may also disclose your information with your permission.

Your Choices

   Analytics Information. You can turn off analytics collection when using
   our programming tools. Please visit this [86]documentation page for
   more information about the data collected and your options.

Third Parties

   Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services
   that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy
   practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy
   Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services
   or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage
   you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to
   them.

Security

   We make reasonable efforts to protect your information by using
   physical and electronic safeguards designed to improve the security of
   the information we maintain. However, because no electronic
   transmission or storage of information can be entirely secure, we can
   make no guarantees as to the security or privacy of your information.

Children's Privacy

   We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from
   children under 18 years of age, and no part of our Service(s) is
   directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with
   personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may
   alert us at [INSERT EMAIL ADDRESS].

International Visitors

   Our Services are hosted in the United States and intended for visitors
   located within the United States. If you choose to use the Services
   from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws
   governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then
   please note that you are transferring your personal information outside
   of those regions to the U.S. for storage and processing. We may also
   transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in
   connection with storage and processing of data, fulfilling your
   requests, and operating the Services. By providing any information,
   including personal information, on or to the Services, you consent to
   such transfer, storage, and processing.

Changes to this Privacy Policy

   We will post any adjustments to the Privacy Policy on this page, and
   the revised version will be effective when it is posted. If we
   materially change the ways in which we use or disclose personal
   information previously collected from you through the Services, we will
   notify you through the Services, by email, or other communication.

   If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our processing
   activities, please email us at privacy@aider.chat.
