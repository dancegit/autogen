Usage

   Run aider with the source code files you want to edit. These files will
   be "added to the chat session", so that aider can see their contents
   and edit them for you. They can be existing files or the name of files
   you want aider to create for you.
aider <file1> <file2> ...

   At the aider > prompt, ask for code changes and aider will edit those
   files to accomplish your request.
$ aider factorial.py

Aider v0.37.1-dev
Models: gpt-4o with diff edit format, weak model gpt-3.5-turbo
Git repo: .git with 258 files
Repo-map: using 1024 tokens
Use /help to see in-chat commands, run with --help to see cmd line args
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
> Make a program that asks for a number and prints its factorial

...

   Use /help <question> to [84]ask for help about using aider, customizing
   settings, troubleshooting, using LLMs, etc.

Adding files

   To edit files, you need to "add them to the chat". Do this by naming
   them on the aider command line. Or, you can use the in-chat /add
   command to add files.

   Only add the files that need to be edited for your task. Don't add a
   bunch of extra files. If you add too many files, the LLM can get
   overwhelmed and confused (and it costs more tokens). Aider will
   automatically pull in content from related files so that it can
   [85]understand the rest of your code base.

   You can use aider without adding any files, and it will try to figure
   out which files need to be edited based on your requests.

   You'll get the best results if you think about which files need to be
   edited. Add just those files to the chat. Aider will include relevant
   context from the rest of your repo.

LLMs

   Aider works best with GPT-4o & Claude 3.5 Sonnet and can [86]connect to
   almost any LLM.
# GPT-4o
$ aider --4o

# Claude 3.5 Sonnet
$ aider --sonnet

   Or you can run aider --model XXX to launch aider with another model.
   During your chat you can switch models with the in-chat /model command.

Making changes

   Ask aider to make changes to your code. It will show you some diffs of
   the changes it is making to complete you request. [87]Aider will git
   commit all of its changes, so they are easy to track and undo.

   You can always use the /undo command to undo AI changes that you don't
   like.
