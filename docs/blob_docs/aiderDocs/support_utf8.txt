Using /help

   Type /help <question> and aider will respond with helpful information.
   You can ask questions about using aider, customizing settings,
   troubleshooting, using LLMs, etc.

   Behind the scenes, aider has indexed all of its [85]documentation. It
   uses the question to find relevant docs and share them with the LLM to
   do retrieval augmented generation (RAG) The LLM also has the full
   context of your ongoing aider chat, so it can help with the exact issue
   you might be facing.

     Aider v0.42.1-dev
     Models: claude-3-5-sonnet with diff edit format
     Repo-map: using 1024 tokens
     Use /help <question> to ask for help, run with -help to see cmd line
     args

/help is the .env file global or for a git repo?

   Based on the provided documentation, here's the answer to your question
   about the .env file in aider:

   The .env file in aider can be both global and specific to a git
   repository. Aider looks for .env files in multiple locations, with the
   following priority order:

   If multiple .env files exist in these locations, they are loaded in the
   order listed above, with files loaded last taking priority. This means
   you can have a global .env file in your home directory with general
   settings, and then override or add to those settings with a
   repo-specific .env file in your git repository root.

   Here are some relevant documentation links that you might find helpful:
     * https://aider.chat/docs/config.html
     * https://aider.chat/docs/config/dotenv.html

   The ability to use both global and repo-specific .env files allows for
   flexible configuration, where you can set default values globally and
   override them on a per-project basis as needed.

/help can i use local LLMs?

   Yes, you can use local LLMs with Aider. Here's a summary of the
   options:
       an OpenAI-compatible API.
       various LLM providers, which may include options for running models
       locally.

   However, it's important to note that Aider works best with more capable
   models. Less capable models may have difficulty properly returning
   "code edits," which could result in Aider not being able to edit your
   files and commit changes effectively.

   For more detailed information on using local LLMs and connecting to
   various models, you might want to check out these relevant
   documentation pages:
     * https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html
     * https://aider.chat/docs/llms/ollama.html
     * https://aider.chat/docs/llms/openai-compat.html

   Keep in mind that the performance and capabilities of local LLMs may
   vary depending on the specific model and your hardware resources.
