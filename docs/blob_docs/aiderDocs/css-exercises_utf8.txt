Complete a css exercise with aider

   In this chat transcript, the user asks about the open source [85]CSS
   Exercises repo and completes an animation exercise.

     $ aider

what is this repo?

   Based on the file list provided, it seems like this repository contains
   a collection of CSS and HTML exercises, solutions, and examples. The
   exercises cover various topics such as Flexbox, Grid, Animation,
   Foundations, and Margin & Padding. The repository also includes images
   and other assets used in the exercises.

/add animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md

     Added animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md to the chat

   Yes, I see the content of the animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md
   file. It describes an exercise to add animation to a dropdown menu,
   creating a bounce illusion when the dropdown expands close to its final
   end state. The desired outcome is shown in a GIF file, and the hints
   provided suggest using the transform-origin property and adding an
   intermediate step to the keyframe at-rule to achieve the bounce effect.

   Is there any specific change or improvement you would like me to make
   to this file or any other file in the repository?

can you make the changes suggested in the readme?

   To make the changes suggested in the
   animation/03-dropdown-menu/README.md, I need to see the contents of the
   following files:

   Please provide the contents of these files so I can suggest the
   necessary changes.

     animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css
     animation/03-dropdown-menu/script.js
     Add these files to the chat? y

   Apologies for the oversight. I see the content of the
   animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css and
   animation/03-dropdown-menu/script.js files now. I will suggest the
   necessary changes to add the bounce animation to the dropdown menu.
animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
.visible {
  display: block;
}
=======
.visible {
  display: block;
  animation: expand 0.3s ease-out;
  transform-origin: top;
}

@keyframes expand {
  0% {
    transform: scaleY(0);
  }
  80% {
    transform: scaleY(1.1);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scaleY(1);
  }
}
>>>>>>> UPDATED

   These changes add the bounce animation to the dropdown menu by creating
   a new keyframe animation called expand. The transform-origin property
   is set to top to make the dropdown menu start transforming from the
   top. The intermediate step at 80% of the animation creates the bounce
   illusion.

     Applied edit to animation/03-dropdown-menu/style.css
     Commit bb3a813 aider: Added bounce animation to dropdown menu.

that worked!

   I'm glad the changes worked for you! If you have any more requests or
   need assistance with other parts of the code, feel free to ask. I'm
   here to help!
