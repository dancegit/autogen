Supported languages

   Aider should work well with most popular coding languages. This is
   because top LLMs are fluent in most mainstream languages, and familiar
   with popular libraries, packages and frameworks.

   Aider has specific support for linting many languages. By default,
   aider runs the built in linter any time a file is edited. If it finds
   syntax errors, aider will offer to fix them for you. This helps catch
   small code issues and quickly fix them.

   Aider also does code analysis to help the LLM navigate larger code
   bases by producing a [85]repository map. Aider can currently produce
   repository maps for many popular mainstream languages, listed below.

How to add support for another language

   Aider should work quite well for other languages, even those without
   repo map or linter support. You should really try coding with aider
   before assuming it needs better support for your language.

   That said, if aider already has support for linting your language, then
   it should be possible to add repo map support. To build a repo map,
   aider needs the tags.scm file from the given language's tree-sitter
   grammar. If you can find and share that file in a [86]GitHub issue,
   then it may be possible to add repo map support.

   If aider doesn't support linting, it will be complicated to add linting
   and repo map support. That is because aider relies on
   [87]py-tree-sitter-languages to provide pre-packaged versions of
   tree-sitter parsers for many languages.

   Aider needs to be easy for users to install in many environments, and
   it is probably too complex to add dependencies on additional individual
   tree-sitter parsers.
