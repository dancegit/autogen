OpenAI o1-preview is SOTA on the aider leaderboard

o1-preview

   OpenAI o1-preview scored 79.7% on aider's code editing benchmark, a
   state of the art result. It achieved this result with the [84]"whole"
   edit format, where the LLM returns a full copy of the source code file
   with changes.

   It is much more practical to use aider's [85]"diff" edit format, which
   allows the LLM to return search/replace blocks to efficiently edit the
   source code. This saves significant time and token costs.

   Using the diff edit format the o1-preview model had a strong benchmark
   score of 75.2%. This likely places o1-preview between Sonnet and GPT-4o
   for practical use, but at significantly higher cost.

o1-mini

   OpenAI o1-mini is priced similarly to GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, but
   scored below those models. It also works best with the whole edit
   format.

Future work

   The o1-preview model had trouble conforming to aider's diff edit
   format. The o1-mini model had trouble conforming to both the whole and
   diff edit formats. Aider is extremely permissive and tries hard to
   accept anything close to the correct formats.

   It is surprising that such strong models had trouble with the syntactic
   requirements of simple text output formats. It seems likely that aider
   could optimize its prompts and edit formats to better harness the o1
   models.

Using aider with o1

   OpenAI's new o1 models are supported in v0.57.0 of aider:
aider --model o1-mini
aider --model o1-preview

     These are initial benchmark results for the o1 models, based on
     aider v0.56.1-dev. See the [86]aider leaderboards for up-to-date
     results based on the latest aider releases.
