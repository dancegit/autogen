Install with pipx

   If you are using aider to work on a python project, sometimes your
   project will require specific versions of python packages which
   conflict with the versions that aider requires. If this happens, the
   python -m pip install command may return errors like these:
aider-chat 0.23.0 requires somepackage==X.Y.Z, but you have somepackage U.W.V wh
ich is incompatible.

   You can avoid this problem by installing aider using pipx, which will
   install it globally on your system within its own python environment.
   This way you can use aider to work on any python project, even if that
   project has conflicting dependencies.

   Install [85]pipx then just do:
pipx install aider-chat

pipx on replit

   To use aider with pipx on replit, you can run these commands in the
   replit shell:
pip install pipx
pipx run aider-chat ...normal aider args...

   If you install aider with pipx on replit and try and run it as just
   aider it will crash with a missing libstdc++.so.6 library.
