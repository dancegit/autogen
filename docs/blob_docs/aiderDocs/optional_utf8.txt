Optional steps

   The steps below are completely optional.
     * [85]Store your api keys
     * [86]Enable Playwright
     * [87]Enable voice coding
     * [88]Add aider to your editor
          + [89]NeoVim
          + [90]VS Code
          + [91]Other editors
     * [92]Install the development version of aider

Store your api keys

   You can [93]store your api keys in a .env file and they will be loaded
   automatically whenever you run aider.

Enable Playwright

   Aider supports adding web pages to the chat with the /web <url>
   command. When you add a url to the chat, aider fetches the page and
   scrapes its content.

   By default, aider uses the httpx library to scrape web pages, but this
   only works on a subset of web pages. Some sites explicitly block
   requests from tools like httpx. Others rely heavily on javascript to
   render the page content, which isn't possible using only httpx.

   Aider works best with all web pages if you install Playwright's
   chromium browser and its dependencies:
playwright install --with-deps chromium

   See the [94]Playwright for Python documentation for additional
   information.

Enable voice coding

   Aider supports [95]coding with your voice using the in-chat /voice
   command. Aider uses the [96]PortAudio library to capture audio.
   Installing PortAudio is completely optional, but can usually be
   accomplished like this:
     * For Windows, there is no need to install PortAudio.
     * For Mac, do brew install portaudio
     * For Linux, do sudo apt-get install libportaudio2

Add aider to your editor

   Other projects have integrated aider into some IDE/editors. It's not
   clear if they are tracking the latest versions of aider, so it may be
   best to just run the latest aider in a terminal alongside your editor.

NeoVim

   [97]joshuavial provided a NeoVim plugin for aider:

   [98]https://github.com/joshuavial/aider.nvim

VS Code

   joshuavial also confirmed that aider works inside a VS Code terminal
   window. Aider detects if it is running inside VSCode and turns off
   pretty/color output, since the VSCode terminal doesn't seem to support
   it well.

Other editors

   If you are interested in creating an aider plugin for your favorite
   editor, please let me know by opening a [99]GitHub issue.

Install the development version of aider

   If you want the very latest development version of aider you can
   install directly from GitHub:
python -m pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Aider-AI/aider.git

   If you've git cloned the aider repository already, you can install
   "live" from your local copy. This is mostly useful if you are
   developing aider and want your current modifications to take effect
   immediately.
python -m pip install -e .
