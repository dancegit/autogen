Analytics

   Aider can collect anonymous analytics to help improve aider's ability
   to work with LLMs, edit code and complete user requests.

Opt-in, anonymous, no personal info

   Analytics are only collected if you agree and opt-in. Aider respects
   your privacy and never collects your code, chat messages, keys or
   personal info.

   Aider collects information on:
     * which LLMs are used and with how many tokens,
     * which of aider's edit formats are used,
     * how often features and commands are used,
     * information about exceptions and errors,
     * etc

   These analytics are associated with an anonymous, randomly generated
   UUID4 user identifier.

   This information helps improve aider by identifying which models, edit
   formats, features and commands are most used. It also helps uncover
   bugs that users are experiencing, so that they can be fixed in upcoming
   releases.

Enabling & disabling analytics

   You can opt out of analytics forever by running this command one time:
aider --analytics-disable

   To enable analytics for a single session, you can run aider with
   --analytics. This will not have any effect if you have permanently
   disabled analytics with the previous command.

   The first time, you will need to agree to opt-in.
aider --analytics

Aider respects your privacy and never collects your code, prompts, chats, keys o
r any personal
info.

Allow collection of anonymous analytics to help improve aider? (Y)es/(N)o [Yes]:

   If you've added analytics: true to your [85]yaml config file, you can
   disable analytics for a single session, you can run:
aider --no-analytics

Details about data being collected

Sample analytics data

   To get a better sense of what type of data is collected, you can review
   some [86]sample analytics logs. These are the last 1,000 analytics
   events from the author's personal use of aider, updated regularly.

Analytics code

   Since aider is open source, all the places where aider collects
   analytics are visible in the source code. They can be viewed using
   [87]GitHub search.

Logging and inspecting analytics

   You can get a full log of the analytics that aider is collecting, in
   case you would like to audit or inspect this data.
aider --analytics-log filename.jsonl

   If you want to just log analytics without reporting them, you can do:
aider --analytics-log filename.jsonl --no-analytics
