Aider can connect to most LLMs

Best models

   Aider works best with these models, which are skilled at editing code:
     * [85]GPT-4o
     * [86]Claude 3.5 Sonnet
     * [87]Claude 3 Opus
     * [88]DeepSeek Coder V2

Free models

   Aider works with a number of free API providers:
     * Google's [89]Gemini 1.5 Pro works with aider, with code editing
       capabilities similar to GPT-3.5.
     * You can use [90]Llama 3 70B on Groq which is comparable to GPT-3.5
       in code editing performance.
     * Cohere also offers free API access to their [91]Command-R+ model,
       which works with aider as a very basic coding assistant.

Local models

   Aider can work also with local models, for example using [92]Ollama. It
   can also access local models that provide an [93]Open AI compatible
   API.

Use a capable model

   Check [94]Aider's LLM leaderboards to see which models work best with
   aider.

   Be aware that aider may not work well with less capable models. If you
   see the model returning code, but aider isn't able to edit your files
   and commit the changes... this is usually because the model isn't
   capable of properly returning "code edits". Models weaker than GPT 3.5
   may have problems working well with aider.
