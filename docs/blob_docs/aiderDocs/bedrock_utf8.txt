Amazon Bedrock

   Aider can connect to models provided by Amazon Bedrock. You will need
   to have an AWS account with access to the Bedrock service.

   To configure Aider to use the Amazon Bedrock API, you need to set up
   your AWS credentials. This can be done using the AWS CLI or by setting
   environment variables.

AWS CLI Configuration

   If you haven't already, install the [85]AWS CLI and configure it with
   your credentials:
aws configure

   This will prompt you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access
   Key, and default region.

Environment Variables

   Alternatively, you can set the following environment variables:
export AWS_REGION=your_preferred_region

# For user authentication
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key

# For profile authentication
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile

   You can add these to your [86].env file.

Bedrock with pipx installation

   The AWS Bedrock provider requires the boto3 package in order to
   function correctly. To use aider installed via pipx with AWS Bedrock,
   you must add the boto3 dependency to aider's virtual environment by
   running
pipx inject aider boto3

Running Aider with Bedrock

   Once your AWS credentials are set up, you can run Aider with the
   --model command line switch, specifying the Bedrock model you want to
   use:
aider --model bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0

Available Models

   To see some models available via Bedrock, run:
aider --list-models bedrock/

   Make sure you have access to these models in your AWS account before
   attempting to use them with Aider.

More info

   For more information on Amazon Bedrock and its models, refer to the
   [87]official AWS documentation.

   Also, see the [88]litellm docs on Bedrock.
