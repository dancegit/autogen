Geographic Latency

   Modal's worker cluster is multi-cloud and multi-region. The vast
   majority of workers are located in the continental USA, but we do run
   workers in Europe and Asia.

   Modal's control plane is hosted in Virginia, USA (us-east-1).

   Any time data needs to travel between the Modal client, our control
   plane servers, and our workers latency will be incurred.
   [81]Cloudping.com provides good estimates on the significance of the
   latency between regions. For example, the roundtrip latency between AWS
   us-east-1 (Virginia, USA) and us-west-1 (California, USA) is around
   60ms.

   You can observe the location identifier of a container [82]via an
   environment variable. Logging this environment variable alongside
   latency information can reveal when geography is impacting your
   application performance.

Region selection

   In cases where low-latency communication is required between your
   container and a network dependency (e.g a database), it is useful to
   ensure that Modal schedules your container in only regions
   geographically proximate to that dependency. For example, if you have
   an AWS RDS database in Virginia, USA (us-east-1), ensuring your Modal
   containers are also scheduled in Virginia means that network latency
   between the container and the database will be less than 5
   milliseconds.
