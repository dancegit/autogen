Introduction

   Modal is a cloud function platform that lets you:
     * Run any code remotely within seconds.
     * Define [81]container environments in code (or use one of our
       pre-built backends).
     * [82]Scale out horizontally to thousands of containers.
     * Attach [83]GPUs with a single line of code.
     * Serve your functions as [84]web endpoints.
     * Deploy and monitor [85]persistent scheduled jobs.
     * Use powerful primitives like [86]distributed dictionaries and
       queues.

   You get [87]full serverless execution and pricing, because we host
   everything and charge per second of usage. Notably, there's zero
   configuration in Modal - everything is code. Take a breath of fresh air
   and feel how good it tastes with no YAML in it.

Getting started

   The nicest thing about all of this is that you don't have to set up any
   infrastructure. Just:
       -m modal setup)

   ...and you can start running jobs right away. Check out some of our
   simple getting started examples:
     * [89]Hello, world!
     * [90]A simple web scraper

   You can also learn Modal interactively without installing anything
   through our [91]code playground.

How does it work?

   Modal takes your code, puts it in a container, and executes it in the
   cloud.

   Where does it run? Modal runs it in its own cloud environment. The
   benefit is that we solve all the hard infrastructure problems for you,
   so you don't have to do anything. You don't need to mess with
   Kubernetes, Docker or even an AWS account.

   Modal is currently Python-only, but we may support other languages in
   the future.
