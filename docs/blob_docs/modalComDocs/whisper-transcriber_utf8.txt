Example: Parallel podcast transcription using Whisper

   OpenAI's late-September 2022 release of the [62]Whisper speech
   recognition model was another eye-widening milestone in the rapidly
   improving field of deep learning, and [63]like others we jumped to try
   Whisper on podcasts.

   The result is the [64]Modal Podcast Transcriber!

   homepage of modal whisper transcriber app

   This example application is more feature-packed than others, and
   doesn't fit in a single page of code and commentary. So instead of
   progressing through the example's code linearly, this post provides a
   higher-level walkthrough of how Modal is used to do fast, on-demand
   podcast episode transcription for whichever podcast you'd like.

Hour-long episodes transcribed in just 1 minute

   The focal point of this demonstration app is that it does serverless
   CPU transcription across dozens of containers at the click of a button,
   completing hour-long audio files in just 1 minute.

   We use a podcast metadata API to allow users to transcribe an arbitrary
   episode from whatever niche podcast a user desires -- [65]how about The
   Pen Addict, a podcast dedicated to stationary?.

   The video below shows the 45-minute long first episode of [66]Serial
   season 2 get transcribed in 62 seconds.

   What's extra cool is that each transcription segment has links back to
   auto-play the original audio. If you read a transcription and wonder,
   did they really say that? Click the timestamp on the right and find
   out!

Try it yourself

   If you're itching to see this in action, here are links to begin
   transcribing the three most popular podcasts on Spotify right now:

Tech-stack overview

   The entire application is hosted serverlessly on Modal and consists of
   these main components:
     * A React + [70]Vite single page application (SPA) deployed as static
       files into a Modal web endpoint.
     * A Modal web endpoint running [71]FastAPI
     * The [72]Podchaser API provides podcast search and episode metadata
       retrieval. It's hooked into our code with a [73]Modal Secret.
     * A Modal async job queue, described in more detail below.

   All of this is deployed with one command and costs $0.00 when it's not
   transcribing podcasts or serving HTTP requests.

Speed-boosting Whisper with parallelism

   Modal's dead-simple parallelism primitives are the key to doing the
   transcription so quickly. Even with a GPU, transcribing a full episode
   serially was taking around 10 minutes.

   But by pulling in ffmpeg with a simple .pip_install("ffmpeg-python")
   addition to our Modal Image, we could exploit the natural silences of
   the podcast medium to partition episodes into hundreds of short
   segments. Each segment is transcribed by Whisper in its own container
   task with 2 physical CPU cores, and when all are done we stitch the
   segments back together with only a minimal loss in transcription
   quality. This approach actually accords quite well with Whisper's model
   architecture:

     "The Whisper architecture is a simple end-to-end approach,
     implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer. Input audio is split
     into 30-second chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and
     then passed into an encoder."

Run this app on Modal

   All source code for this example can be [75]found on GitHub. The
   README.md includes instructions on setting up the frontend build and
   getting authenticated with the Podchaser API. Happy transcribing!
