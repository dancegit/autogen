Environment variables

Runtime environment variables

   The Modal runtime sets several environment variables during
   initialization. The keys for these environment variables are reserved
   and cannot be overridden by your Function configuration.

   The following variables provide information about the function's
   runtime environment:
     * MODAL_CLOUD_PROVIDER -- Modal executes functions across a number of
       cloud providers ([81]AWS, [82]GCP, [83]OCI). This variable
       specifies which cloud provider the Modal Function is running
       within.
     * MODAL_ENVIRONMENT -- The name of the [84]Modal Environment the
       function is running within.
     * MODAL_IMAGE_ID -- The ID of the [85]modal.Image used by the Modal
       Function.
     * MODAL_IS_REMOTE - Set to `1' to indicate that the function code is
       running in a remote container.
     * MODAL_REGION -- This will correspond to a geographic area
       identifier from the cloud provider associated with the Function
       (see above). For AWS, the identifier is a "region". For GCP it is a
       "zone", and for OCI it is an "availability domain". Example values
       are us-east-1 (AWS), us-central1 (GCP), us-ashburn-1 (OCI).
     * MODAL_TASK_ID -- The ID of the container running the Modal
       Function.

Container image environment variables

   The container image layers used by a Modal Function's modal.Image may
   set environment variables. These variables will be present within your
   Function's runtime environment. For example, the [86]debian_slim image
   sets the GPG_KEY variable.

   To override image variables or set new ones, use the [87].env method
   provided by modal.Image.
