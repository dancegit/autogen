Timeouts

   All Modal [81]Function executions have a default execution timeout of
   300 seconds (5 minutes), but users may specify timeout durations
   between 10 seconds and 24 hours.
import time


@app.function()
def f():
    time.sleep(599)  # Timeout!


@app.function(timeout=600)
def g():
    time.sleep(599)
    print("*Just* made it!")

   The timeout duration is a measure of a Function's execution time. It
   does not include scheduling time or any other period besides the time
   your code is executing in Modal. This duration is also per execution
   attempt, meaning Functions configured with [82]modal.Retries will start
   new execution timeouts on each retry. For example, an infinite-looping
   Function with a 100 second timeout and 3 allowed retries will run for
   least 400 seconds within Modal.

Handling timeouts

   After exhausting any specified retries, a timeout in a Function will
   produce a modal.exception.FunctionTimeoutError which you may catch in
   your code.
import modal.exception


@app.function(timeout=100)
def f():
    time.sleep(200)  # Timeout!


@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    try:
        f.remote()
    except modal.exception.FunctionTimeoutError:
        ... # Handle the timeout.

Timeout accuracy

   Functions will run for at least as long as their timeout allows, but
   they may run a handful of seconds longer. If you require accurate and
   precise timeout durations on your Function executions, it is
   recommended that you implement timeout logic in your user code.
