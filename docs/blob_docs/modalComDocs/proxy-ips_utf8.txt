Proxies (beta)

   You can securely connect with resources in your private network using a
   Modal Proxy. Proxies are a secure tunnel between Apps and exit nodes
   with static IPs. You can allow-list those static IPs in your network
   firewall, making sure that only traffic originating from these IP
   addresses is allowed into your network.

   Proxies are unique and not shared between workspaces. All traffic
   between your Apps and the Proxy server is encrypted using
   [81]Wireguard.

   Modal Proxies are in beta. Please let us know if you run into issues.

Creating a Proxy

   Proxies are available for [82]Team Plan users.

   You can create Proxies in your workspace [83]Settings page. There's a
   limit of one IP per workspace. Please reach out to
   [84]support@modal.com if you need more than one Proxy.

Using a Proxy

   After a Proxy is online, add it to a Modal Function with the argument
   proxy=Proxy.from_name("<your-proxy>"). For example:
import modal
import subprocess

app = modal.App(image=modal.Image.debian_slim().apt_install("curl"))

@app.function(proxy=modal.Proxy.from_name("<your-proxy>"))
def my_ip():
    subprocess.run(["curl", "-s", "ifconfig.me"])

@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    my_ip.remote()

   (BUTTON) Copy

   All network traffic from your Function will now use the Proxy as a
   tunnel.

   The program above will always print the same IP address independent of
   where it runs in Modal's infrastructure. If that same program were to
   run without a Proxy, it would print a different IP address depending on
   where it runs.
