Connecting Modal to your Datadog account

   You can use the [81]Modal + Datadog Integration to export Modal
   function logs to Datadog. You'll find the Modal Datadog Integration
   available for install in the Datadog marketplace.

What this integration does

   This integration allows you to:

Installing the integration

       integrations page
       You will be redirected to log into Modal, and once logged in,
       you'll be redirected to the Datadog authorization page.

Structured logging

   Logs from Modal are sent to Datadog in plaintext without any structured
   parsing. This means that if you have custom log formats, you'll need to
   set up a [84]log processing pipeline in Datadog to parse them.

   Modal passes log messages in the .message field of the log record. To
   parse logs, you should operate over this field. Note that the Modal
   Integration does set up some basic pipelines. In order for your
   pipelines to work, ensure that your pipelines come before Modal's
   pipelines in your log settings.

Cost Savings

   The Modal Datadog Integration will forward all logs to Datadog which
   could be costly for verbose apps. We recommend using either [85]Log
   Pipelines or [86]Index Exclusion Filters to filter logs before they are
   sent to Datadog.

   The Modal Integration tags all logs with the environment attribute. The
   simplest way to filter logs is to create a pipeline that filters on
   this attribute and to isolate verbose apps in a separate environment.

Uninstalling the integration

   Once the integration is uninstalled, all logs will stop being sent to
   Datadog, and authorization will be revoked.
