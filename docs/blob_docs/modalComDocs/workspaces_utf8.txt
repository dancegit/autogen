Workspaces

   A workspace is an area where a user can deploy Modal apps and other
   resources. There are two types of workspaces: personal and shared.
   After a new user has signed up to Modal, a personal workspace is
   automatically created for them. The name of the personal workspace is
   based on your GitHub username, but it might be randomly generated if
   already taken or invalid.

   To collaborate with others, a new shared workspace needs to be created.

Create a Workspace

   All additional workspaces are shared workspaces, meaning you can invite
   others by email to collaborate with you. There are two ways to create a
   Modal workspace on the [81]settings page.

   view of workspaces creation interface

   If you're interested in having a workspace associated with your Okta
   organization, then check out our [83]Okta SSO docs.

Auto-joining a Workspace associated with a GitHub organization

   Note: This is only relevant for Workspaces created from a GitHub
   organization.

   Users can automatically join a Workspace on their [84]Workspace
   settings page if they are a member of the GitHub organization
   associated with the Workspace.

   To turn off this functionality a Workspace Manager can disable it on
   the Workspace Management tab of their Workspace's settings page.

Inviting new Workspace members

   To invite a new Workspace member, you can visit the [85]settings page
   and navigate to the members tab for the appropriate workspace.

   You can either send an email invite or share an invite link. Both
   existing Modal users and non-existing users can use the links to join
   your workspace. If they are a new user a Modal account will be created
   for them.

Create a token for a Workspace

   To interact with a Workspace's resources programmatically, you need to
   add an API token for that Workspace. Your existing API tokens are
   displayed on [86]the settings page and new API tokens can be added for
   a particular Workspace.

   After adding a token for a Workspace to your Modal config file you can
   activate that Workspace's profile using the CLI (see below).

   As an manager or workspace owner you can manage active tokens for a
   workspace on [87]the member tokens page. For more information on API
   token management see the [88]documentation about configuration.

Switching active Workspace

   When on the dashboard or using the CLI, the active profile determines
   which personal or organizational Workspace is associated with your
   actions.

Dashboard

   You can switch between organization Workspaces and your Personal
   Workspace by using the workspace selector at the top of [89]the
   dashboard.

CLI

   To switch the Workspace associated with CLI commands, use modal profile
   activate.

Administrating workspace members

   Workspaces have three different levels of access privileges:
     * Owner
     * Manager
     * User

   The user that creates a workspace is automatically set as the Owner for
   that workspace. The owner can assign any other roles within the
   workspace, as well as disable other members of the workspace.

   A Manager within a workspace can assign all roles except Owner and can
   also disable other members of the workspace.

   A User of a workspace can not assign any access privileges within the
   workspace but can otherwise perform any action like running and
   deploying apps and modify Secrets.

   As an Owner or Manager you can administrate the access privileges of
   other members on the members tab in [90]settings.

Leaving a Workspace

   To leave a workspace, navigate to [91]the settings page and click
   "Leave" on a listed Workspace. There must be at least one owner
   assigned to a workspace.
