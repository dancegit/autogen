Jupyter notebooks

   You can use the Modal client library in notebook environments like
   Jupyter! Just import modal and use as normal. However, there are some
   limitations when using Modal within notebooks.

Known issues

     * Interactive shell and interactive functions are not supported.
       These can only be run within a live terminal session, so they are
       not supported in notebooks.

   If you encounter issues not documented above, first check your Modal
   client version is >=0.49.2142. Also, try restarting the notebook
   kernel, as it may be in a broken state, which is common in notebook
   development.

   If the issue persists, contact us [81]in our Slack.

   We are working on removing these known issues so that writing Modal
   applications in a notebook feels just like developing in regular Python
   modules and scripts.

Jupyter inside Modal

   You can run Jupyter in Modal using the modal launch command. For
   example:
$ modal launch jupyter --gpu a10g

   (BUTTON) Copy

   That will start a Jupyter instance with an A10G GPU attached. You'll be
   able to access the app with via a [82]Modal Tunnel URL. Jupyter will
   stop running whenever you stop Modal call in your terminal.

   See --help for additional options.
