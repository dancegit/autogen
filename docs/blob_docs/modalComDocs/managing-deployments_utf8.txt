Managing deployments

   Once you've finished using modal run or modal serve to iterate on your
   Modal code, it's time to deploy. A Modal deployment creates and then
   persists an application and its objects, providing the following
   benefits:
     * Repeated application function executions will be grouped under the
       deployment, aiding observability and usage tracking.
       Programmatically triggering lots of ephemeral App runs can clutter
       your web and CLI interfaces.
     * Function calls are much faster because deployed functions are
       persistent and reused, not created on-demand by calls. Learn how to
       trigger deployed functions in [81]Invoking deployed functions.
     * [82]Scheduled functions will continue scheduling separate from any
       local iteration you do, and will notify you on failure.
     * [83]Web endpoints keep running when you close your laptop, and
       their URL address matches the deployment name.

Creating deployments

   Deployments are created using the [84]modal deploy command.
 % modal deploy whisper_pod_transcriber.main

   Running this command on an existing deployment will redeploy the App,
   incrementing its version. For detail on how live deployed apps
   transition between versions, see the [85]Updating deployments section.

   Deployments can also be created using [86]Modal's client library.

Viewing deployments

   Deployments can be viewed either on the [87]apps web page or by using
   the [88]modal app list command.

Updating deployments

   A deployment can deploy a new App or redeploy a new version of an
   existing deployed App. It's useful to understand how Modal handles the
   transition between versions of running deployment. Modal deployments
   only take a few seconds, but we still ensure things run smoothly in
   this short deployment period.

   A deployed App will continue running and accepting requests while a new
   deployment is happening. Existing function executions will also keep
   running. They will not be terminated by the deployment because they're
   outdated.

   However, any existing container running the old version of the App will
   be marked by Modal as outdated and will become ineligible to serve new
   requests. These outdated containers will become idle and gracefully
   terminate.

   Any warm pool containers will also be cycled during a deployment, as
   the previous version's warm pool are now outdated.

Deployment rollbacks

   To quickly reset an App back to a previous version, you can perform a
   deployment rollback. Rollbacks can be triggered from either the App
   dashboard or the CLI. Rollback deployments look like new deployments:
   they increment the version number and are attributed to the user who
   triggered the rollback. But the App's functions and metadata will be
   reset to their previous state independently of your current App
   codebase.

   Note that deployment rollbacks are supported only on the Team and
   Enterprise plans.

Stopping deployments

   Deployed apps can be stopped in the web UI by clicking the red delete
   button on the deployment's App page, or alternatively by using the
   [89]modal app stop command.

   Stopped deployments are eventually garbage collected.
